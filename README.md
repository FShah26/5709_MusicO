# 5709_MusicO

MusicO is a music streaming website that lets users listen to music without the hassle of downloading it. MusicO contains various features like creating and importing playlists, following other users, searching for artists and albums, rating, and shuffling albums. The applicationâ€™s uses ReactJS and Bootstrap for client-side, SpringBoot framework for server-side and MySQL as the database technology. The client-side interacts with the server-side by using REST API calls. About 9 out of the 12 proposed features have been completed.
